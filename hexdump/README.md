# hexdump.scm

I didn't touch Scheme since a long time, _hexdump_ is a good test!

This code is not very beautiful, but I'm glad, I recover some Scheme skills including
closures and exceptions. And this code is R7RS compliant. It works with __Gauche__, __Sagittarius__, __Chicken__. _Foment__ gives me some headaches.
