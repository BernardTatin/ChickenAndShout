# hexdump.scm

I didn't touch Scheme since a long time, _hexdump_ is a good test!

This code is not very beautiful, but I'm glad, I recover some Scheme skill including
closures and exceptions. I even did _units_ and a nice _Makefile_!

On Linux, _make all_ builds the progam. On BSD and Solaris, use _gmake all_.
