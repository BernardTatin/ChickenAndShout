# ChickenAndShout

```scheme
(and (or (Chicken Scheme) (Foment Scheme) (Sagittarius Scheme)) (not Bugs) (I hope))
```

Slow development because happiness does not like speed.

This code was first made with _Chicken Scheme_. Now, it is ported to _r7rs_ and works well 
with __Foment__, __Sagittarius__, __Chicken__ and __Gauche__.
Sometimes, __Foment__ does not agree with my code.
