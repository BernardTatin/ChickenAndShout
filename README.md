# ChickenAndShout

```scheme
(and (or (Chicken Scheme) (Foment Scheme) (Sagittarius Scheme)) (not Bugs) (I hope))
```

Slow development because happiness does not like speed.

This code was first made with _Chicken Scheme_. Now, it is ported to _r7rs_ and works well 
with __Foment__, __Sagittarius__ and __Gauche__. __Chicken__ has problem with libraries 
(or I have problems with __Chicken__ and libraries) so this code does not work any more 
with __Chicken__.
